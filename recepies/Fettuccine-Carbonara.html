    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I can see the purists out there raising their fists. Yes, I know, I know - carbonara recipes don’t traditionally have cream in them! But depending on my mood I sometimes like to add it. When I’m calm and focussed, I go the authentic route; where hot pasta is added to a mixture of egg and finely grated parmesan and gently tossed off the heat until a silky sauce forms, lightly covering the pasta strands. It’s not necessarily difficult, you just have to ensure the eggs aren’t over or under cooked.

        Some nights when craving the umami bomb that is carbonara without the guesswork I turn to this recipe. It’s perfect! The clever addition of cream stabilises the egg mixture, giving you the authentic taste with a safety net!
