          Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of
          very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish
          made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as
          ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices.

        <p>
          This is a real spaghetti carbonara recipe made the traditional Italian
          way, without a single drop of cream. It relies solely on egg and
          cheese to make a luscious, creamy carbonara sauce. Food fit for a king
          (or queen!) that proves simple can be magnificent.

          Japanese curry is commonly served in three main forms: curry over
          rice, curry udon, and curry bread. It is one of the most popular
          dishes in Japan. The very common "curry rice" is most often referred
          to simply as "curry". Along with the sauce, a wide variety of
          vegetables and meats are used to make Japanese curry.
